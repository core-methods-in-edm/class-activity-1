## class activity 1

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

DF1 <- read.csv("swirl-data.csv", header = TRUE)

##5. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
DF2 <- select(DF1, hash, lesson_name, attempt)

##6. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(attempt = sum(attempt))
## same as DF3 <- summarise(group_by(DF2, hash, lesson_name), attempt = sum(attempt))


##8. Convert `DF3` to this format  
DF3b <- spread(DF3, lesson_name, attempt)

##9. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `correct`
DF4 <- select(DF1, hash, lesson_name, correct)

##10. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0` 
DF4$correct <- ifelse(DF4$correct == TRUE, 1, 0)

##11. Create a new data frame called `DF5` that provides a mean score for each student on each course
DF5 <- 
  ##summarise(group_by(DF4, hash, lesson_name), mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))
  DF4 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(mean = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))

##12. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF6`) that shows the average correct for each day
DF6 <- select(DF1, correct, datetime)

DF6$correct <- ifelse(DF6$correct == TRUE, 1, 0)

DF6$datetime <- as.POSIXlt(DF6$datetime, origin = "1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC")

DF6$datetime <- strftime(DF6$datetime, format="%m-%d-%y")

DF7 <- summarise(group_by(DF6, datetime), average = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))
```
